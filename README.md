# TicTacToe_Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game is designed for two players, where one player uses **X** and the other uses **O** to take turns marking the 3x3 grid.

## How to Play

1. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid of boxes.
2. Player O goes first, followed by Player X.
3. Players take turns clicking on an empty box to place their mark (O or X).
4. The game checks for a winner after each turn. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all boxes are filled and no player has won, the game will declare a **draw**.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Winning boxes are highlighted in **light green**.
- Player X’s marks are displayed in **green**, and Player O’s marks are displayed in **red**.
- Option to **reset** the game at any time or start a **new game** after a winner is declared.
